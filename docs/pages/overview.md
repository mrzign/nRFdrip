### Overview

![alt text](images/nRFdrip_2.png "nRFdrip")

The hardware inside nRFdrip consists of two parts
* A small, but powerful, 32-bit ARM M0 CPU with integrated Bluetooth 4.0 support (nRF51822)
* A proprietary RF module (CC2500) that is used to receive the Dexcom G4 sensor data. 

The benefits of using nRF51822 are many. It is not just very small and powerful, it gives you the freedom to control the Bluetooth protocol implementation
and it is know for its extreme low power modes. The CC2500 is a simple RF receiver also know for extreme low power modes. 

These two combined gives you a hardware platform which has low power consumption, and pocket sized.
