### What is this?
The nRFdrip acts as a bridge between a Dexcom G4 CGM sensor and your Android phone. It shares the similar functionality as the classic [xDrip], but the nRFdrip is a bridge based on different hardware.
The main focus and target when developing nRFdrip was to make a bridge that could fit your pocket, be reliable and run for many days without the need of charging.
